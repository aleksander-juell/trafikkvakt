# WhatsApp Alternative Setup - Manual Configuration

Since the automatic WhatsApp Web integration is having issues with browser dependencies, here's an alternative approach:

## Option 1: Manual WhatsApp Integration (Recommended for now)

### Setup Steps:
1. **Use WhatsApp Business App** on your phone
2. **Create a shared family/admin phone number** for the school
3. **Set up the parent group** manually in WhatsApp
4. **Send notifications manually** for now

### Temporary Manual Workflow:
1. Each morning, check the duties for today
2. Copy the duty information
3. Send manually to the WhatsApp group

### Sample Message Template:
```
🚸 Trafikkvakt mandag 25. september

Følgende barn har trafikkvakt i dag:

1. Ameli - Holmen gate/Tovesvingen
2. Johan - Holmen gate/Åsenveien

📍 Møtetid: 07:30
⏰ Husk refleksvest!

Ha en fin dag! 😊
```

## Option 2: Fix Browser Dependencies

If you want to continue with the automatic integration, we need to:

1. Install Chrome/Chromium manually
2. Set proper environment variables
3. Fix Puppeteer browser paths

## Option 3: Use WhatsApp Business API

For a production solution, consider:
- WhatsApp Business API (paid)
- Twilio WhatsApp API
- Other business messaging services

## Current Status
- ✅ Server integration is ready
- ✅ Message formatting works
- ✅ Scheduling system is ready
- ❌ Browser automation needs fixing

The rest of the system is fully functional - only the WhatsApp Web automation needs browser dependencies resolved.
